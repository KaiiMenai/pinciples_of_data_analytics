### Notes and Tips

To save changes made to the README file:
- Click on Source Control option on the left.
- In Message box, enter what the changes were i.e. changed README.
- Click on the Commit button and this will save changes to the project, this will save the state of the project as it is now.

To sync the changes with GitHub:
- Following saving changes to the README file through the Source Control and Commit functions, there should now be a Sync Changes button.
- Click on the Sync Changes button, this will then sync the commited changes from the development environment (github.dev) with GitHub.

## Week 1 
- Set up GitHub, sync with machine, update README.md file

## Week 2

## Week 3

Data - are a *collection* of discrete or continuous calues that convey information, describing the quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted formally.

Datum - an *individual* value in a collection of data.

### Big vs. Small Data

Big data refers to extremely large volumes of data that are too complex or large to be processed by traditional data management tools. 
It is often characterized by the "three Vs": 
- Volume (huge amounts of data), 
- Velocity (the speed at which it is generated and processed), 
- Variety (the diversity of data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data). 
Big data is used for advanced analytics, machine learning, and predictive insights.

Small data, on the other hand, refers to data sets that are smaller, more manageable, and can often be processed with traditional data tools. It typically involves structured data with a clear format, often used in more straightforward analysis and decision-making processes. Small data can be handled with simple tools and is commonly used by small businesses or individual applications.

Key differences:

- Volume: Big data involves large, complex data sets; small data is more limited in size.
-  Complexity: Big data can include unstructured data from multiple sources, while small data is often clean, structured, and easier to analyse.
- Tools and processing: Big data requires advanced technologies (like Hadoop, Spark), while small data can often be handled by simpler software like Excel or SQL.

In short, *BIG DATA* is vast and requires advanced tools for analysis, while *SMALL DATA* is more accessible and easier to manage and analyse.
